# Leisaac Docs Website

Leisaac docs website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

Make sure your working dir is `leisaac/docs`.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

>[!NOTE] 
> The Leisaac repository is already configured with GitHub Actions. You only need to modify the relevant documents, verify the results locally, and then submit a PR; manual deployment is not necessary.
