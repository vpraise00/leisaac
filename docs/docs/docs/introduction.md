Leisaac provides teleoperation functionality in [IsaacLab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html) using the SO101Leader ([LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)), including data collection, data conversion, and subsequent policy training.

- 🤖 We use the SO101 Follower robot (and other related robot) in IsaacLab and provide practical teleoperation methods.
- 🔄 Ready-to-use scripts convert HDF5 data into the LeRobot dataset format.
- 🧠 Simulation data is used to fine-tune [GR00T N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) and deploy the policy on real hardware. And more policies will be supported.
