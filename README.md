# LeIsaac 🚀

This repository provides teleoperation functionality in [IsaacLab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html) using the SO101Leader ([LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)), including data collection, data conversion, and subsequent policy training.

- 🤖 We use SO101Follower as the robot (and other related robot) in IsaacLab and provide relevant teleoperation method.
- 🔄 We offer scripts to convert data from HDF5 format to the LeRobot Dataset.
- 🧠 We utilize simulation-collected data to fine-tune [GR00T N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) and deploy it on real hardware. And more policies will be supported.
