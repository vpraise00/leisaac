## Device Setup üéÆ

We use the SO101Leader as the teleoperation device. Please follow the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101) for connection and configuration.

## Teleoperation Usage üïπÔ∏è

You can run teleoperation tasks with the following script:

```shell
python scripts/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --teleop_device=so101leader \
    --port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
    --num_envs=1 \
    --device=cuda \
    --enable_cameras \
    --record \
    --dataset_file=./datasets/dataset.hdf5
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Parameter descriptions for teleop_se3_agent.py</strong></summary><p></p>

- `--task`: Specify the task environment name to run, e.g., `LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0`.

- `--seed`: Specify the seed for environment, e.g., `42`.

- `--teleop_device`: Specify the teleoperation device type, e.g., `so101leader`, `bi-so101leader`, `keyboard`.

-  `--port`: Specify the port of teleoperation device, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`. Only used when teleop_device is `so101leader`.

- `--left_arm_port`: Specify the port of left arm, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`. Only used when teleop_device is `bi-so101leader`.

- `--right_arm_port`: Specify the port of right arm, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM1`. Only used when teleop_device is `bi-so101leader`.

- `--num_envs`: Set the number of parallel simulation environments, usually `1` for teleoperation.

- `--device`: Specify the computation device, such as `cpu` or `cuda` (GPU).

- `--enable_cameras`: Enable camera sensors to collect visual data during teleoperation.

- `--record`: Enable data recording; saves teleoperation data to an HDF5 file.

- `--dataset_file`: Path to save the recorded dataset, e.g., `./datasets/record_data.hdf5`.

</details>


If the calibration file does not exist at the specified cache path, or if you launch with `--recalibrate`, you will be prompted to calibrate the SO101Leader.  Please refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101#calibration-video) for calibration steps.

After entering the IsaacLab window, press the `b` key on your keyboard to start teleoperation. You can then use the specified teleop_device to control the robot in the simulation. If you need to reset the environment after completing your operation, simply press the `r` or `n` key. `r` means resetting the environment and marking the task as failed, while `n` means resetting the environment and marking the task as successful.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter permission errors like `ConnectionError`, you may need to run:

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

# or just add your user in related groups
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

## Dataset Replay üì∫

After teleoperation, you can replay the collected dataset in the simulation environment using the following script:

```shell
python scripts/environments/teleoperation/replay.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --num_envs=1 \
    --device=cuda \
    --enable_cameras \
    --replay_mode=action \
    --dataset_file=./datasets/dataset.hdf5 \
    --select_episodes 1 2
```

<details>

</details>

## Data Convention & Conversion üìä

Collected teleoperation data is stored in HDF5 format in the specified directory. We provide a script to convert HDF5 data to the LeRobot Dataset format. Only successful episode will be converted.

>[!NOTE] 
> This script depends on the LeRobot runtime environment. We recommend using a separate Conda environment for LeRobot‚Äîsee the official [LeRobot repo](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions.

You can modify the parameters in the script and run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/convert/isaaclab2lerobot.py
```

## Policy Training üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[GR00T N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) provides a fine-tuning workflow based on the LeRobot Dataset. You can refer to [nvidia/gr00t-n1.5-so101-tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/nvidia/gr00t-n1-5-so101-tuning) to fine-tune it with your collected lerobot data. We take pick-orange task as an example.

- First, collect a pick-orange dataset in simulation.
- Then, fine-tune GR00T N1.5 using this data.
- Finally, deploy the trained policy on real hardware.

## Policy Inference üß©

We also provide interfaces for running policy inference in simulation. You can start inference with the following script (take gr00tn1.5 as example):

```shell
python scripts/evaluation/policy_inference.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --eval_rounds=10 \
    --policy_type=gr00tn1.5 \
    --policy_host=localhost \
    --policy_port=5555 \
    --policy_timeout_ms=5000 \
    --policy_action_horizon=16 \
    --policy_language_instruction="Pick up the orange and place it on the plate" \
    --device=cuda
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Parameter descriptions for policy_inference.py</strong></summary><p></p>

- `--task`: Name of the task environment to run for inference (e.g., `LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0`).

- `--seed`: Seed of environment (default: current time).

- `--episode_length_s`: Episode length in seconds (default: `60`).

- `--eval_rounts`: Number of evaluation rounds. 0 means don't add time out termination, policy will run until success or manual reset (default: `0`) 

- `--policy_type`: Type of policy to use (default: `gr00tn1.5`).
    - now we support `gr00tn1.5`, `lerobot-<model_type>`

- `--policy_host`: Host address of the policy server (default: `localhost`).

- `--policy_port`: Port of the policy server (default: `5555`).

- `--policy_timeout_ms`: Timeout for the policy server in milliseconds (default: `5000`).

- `--policy_action_horizon`: Number of actions to predict per inference (default: `16`).

- `--policy_language_instruction`: Language instruction for the policy (e.g., task description in natural language).

- `--policy_checkpoint_path`: Path to the policy checkpoint (if required).

- `--device`: Computation device, such as `cpu` or `cuda`.

You may also use additional arguments supported by IsaacLab's `AppLauncher` (see their documentation for details).

</details>

Depending on your use case, you may need to install additional dependencies to enable inference:

```shell
pip install -e "source/leisaac[gr00t]"
pip install -e "source/leisaac[lerobot-async]"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For service-based policies, you must start the corresponding service before running inference. For example, with GR00T, you need to launch the GR00T N1.5 inference server first. You can refer to the [GR00T evaluation documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T?tab=readme-ov-file#4-evaluation) for detailed instructions.

Below are the currently supported policy inference methods:

<details>
<summary><strong>lerobot official policy</strong></summary><p></p>

We utilize lerobot's async inference capabilities for policy execution. For detailed information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/async). Prior to execution, ensure that the policy server is running.

```shell
python scripts/evaluation/policy_inference.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --policy_type=lerobot-smolvla \
    --policy_host=localhost \
    --policy_port=8080 \
    --policy_timeout_ms=5000 \
    --policy_language_instruction='Pick the orange to the plate' \
    --policy_checkpoint_path=outputs/smolvla/leisaac-pick-orange/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model \
    --policy_action_horizon=50 \
    --device=cuda \
    --enable_cameras
```

</details>


## Waypoint-Based Data Collection üéØ

For automated demonstration collection, we provide a waypoint-based control system. This allows you to define robot trajectories as sequences of target positions and automatically execute them with recording capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Define trajectories as JSON waypoint sequences
- Multiple controller backends (DifferentialIK, OperationalSpaceController)
- Automatic data recording in HDF5 format
- Direct conversion to LeRobot format and HuggingFace upload

**Quick Example:**
```bash
# Collect demonstrations using waypoints
python scripts/environments/waypoints/bi_arm_waypoint_data_collection.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-CleanToyTable-BiArm-v0 \
    --waypoint_file="playground/waypoints/bi_arm_demo.json" \
    --controller_type=dik \
    --record \
    --dataset_file="datasets/demos.hdf5" \
    --num_demos=50 \
    --enable_cameras
```

## Extra Feature ‚ú®

We also provide some additional features. You can refer to the following instructions to try them out.

<details>
<summary><strong>DigitalTwin Env: Make Sim2Real Simple</strong></summary><p></p>

Inspired by the greenscreening functionality from [SIMPLER](https://simpler-env.github.io/) and [ManiSkill](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), we have implemented DigitalTwin Env. This feature allows you to replace the background in simulation environments with real background images while preserving the foreground elements such as robotic arms and interactive objects. This approach significantly reduces the gap between simulation and reality, enabling better sim2real transfer.

To use this feature, simply create a task configuration class that inherits from `ManagerBasedRLDigitalTwinEnvCfg` and launch it through the corresponding environment. In the configuration class, you can specify relevant parameters including overlay_mode, background images path, and foreground environment components to preserve. 

For usage examples, please refer to the sample task: [LiftCubeDigitalTwinEnvCfg](https://github.com/LightwheelAI/leisaac/blob/main/source/leisaac/leisaac/tasks/lift_cube/lift_cube_env_cfg.py).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>MimicGen Env: Generate Data From Demonstrations</strong></summary><p></p>

We have integrated [IsaacLab MimicGen](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/overview/teleop_imitation.html), a powerful feature that automatically generates additional demonstrations from expert demonstrations.

To use this functionality, you first need to record some demonstrations. Recording scripts can be referenced from the instructions above. (Below we use the MimicGen for the `LeIsaac-SO101-LiftCube-v0` task as an example).

> **[NOTE]** 
> Pay attention to the `input_file` and `output_file` parameters in the following scripts. Typically, the `output_file` from the previous script becomes the `input_file` for the next script.

Since MimicGen requires trajectory generalization based on end-effector pose and object pose, we first convert joint-position-based action data to IK-based action data. The conversion process is as follows, where `input_file` specifies the collected demonstration data:

```shell
python scripts/mimic/eef_action_process.py \
    --input_file ./datasets/mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --output_file ./datasets/processed_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --to_ik --headless
```

Next, we perform sub-task annotation based on the converted action data. Annotation can be done in two ways: automatic and manual. If you want to use automatic annotation, please add the `--auto` startup option.

```shell
python scripts/mimic/annotate_demos.py \
    --device cuda \
    --task LeIsaac-SO101-LiftCube-Mimic-v0 \
    --input_file ./datasets/processed_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --output_file ./datasets/annotated_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --enable_cameras
```

After annotation is complete, we can proceed with data generation. The generation process is as follows:

```shell
python scripts/mimic/generate_dataset.py \
    --device cuda \
    --num_envs 1 \
    --generation_num_trials 10 \
    --input_file ./datasets/annotated_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --output_file ./datasets/generated_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --enable_cameras
```

After obtaining the generated data, we also provide a conversion script to transform it from IK-based action data back to joint-position-based action data, as follows:

```shell
python scripts/mimic/eef_action_process.py \
    --input_file ./datasets/generated_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --output_file ./datasets/final_generated_mimic-lift-cube-example.hdf5 \
    --to_joint --headless
```

Finally, you can use replay to view the effects of the generated data. It's worth noting that due to the inherent randomness in IsaacLab simulation, the replay performance may vary.
